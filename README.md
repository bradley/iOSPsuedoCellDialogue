About this Project
------

While the name is a bit weird, this project is fairly straightforward. We wanted a way to take a typical cell from one of our collection views and display it at any time above other content across the app. If you've ever used Vine to upload, you might be familiar with this. Essentially, in Vine if you are uploading several items, you can see the most recent item added for upload in a little dropped-down bar above your feed, and can click this progress area to see the progress of other uploads.

This app kind of shows how to do something like that in a DRY manner.
